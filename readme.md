You'll need to create an `extlib/` folder at the root of the project, with:
* [flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs)
* [effolkronium/random](https://github.com/effolkronium/random)
* [BearLibTerminal](https://github.com/tommyettinger/BearLibTerminal) (download is [here](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal#download))
* Libtcod (use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg))

Todo:
* Develop a string that is fixed size
* GUI 
* Basic AI
* XP and leveling up
* Items and inventory
* Ranged combat
* Serialisation
* Game menu
